about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am a research fellow in the [Dyson Robotics Lab](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/dyson-robotics-lab) with [Prof. Andrew Davison](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ajd/) at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/).

  During my PhD, I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Stefan Leutenegger](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/leutenegger-stefan) on making real-time dense visual SLAM more robust through the fusion of inertial data and learned depth priors. Previously, I completed a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca).

  My current research interests are in developing algorithms that enable robots to understand and interact with their environment. To this end, my research focuses on:
    - dense 3D reconstruction with informative geometric priors (learned or parametric),
    - efficient scene segmentation using sparse semantic annotations and neural fields,
    - learning robust object manipulation policies, and
    - estimating human motion from moving cameras.

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
